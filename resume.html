		<mainheading>About</mainheading>
			<div id="divline"></div>
		<br>
		<t>I am currently working toward a Bachelor of Business Associate with a specialization 
		in finance. After narrowing down my interests at Kwantlen Polytechnic, I decided to pursue 
		my education full time at Trinity Western University. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I am a hard working and ambitious employee who invests personally in any organization 
		in which I am placed. I am a natural leader who knows how to create task flows and delegate, 
		but also knows how to work in a team environment.
		<br>
		<br>
		A person with diverse experiences and an even more diverse portfolio of interests, 
		I draw from many cultures and world views in order to connect with professionals and 
		solve problems effectively and efficiently.
		<br>
		<br>
		In the future I want to pursue professional designation and work internationally to develop 
		and manage investments for corporations and financial institutions. In the longer term 
		I am interested in bringing my expertise in finance across the world and helping others 
		discover more about finance than what they hear on the news.
		<br>
		<br>
		Beyond finance, I am passionate about specialty coffee and film photography. While these
		passions rarely merge with the world of finance I am always looking for intersections between 
		the two. The time, attention and science behind a carefully-made cup of coffee 
		and the deliberateness of film photography are what draw me to these topics. In the same way, 
		attention to detail and curation of financial services and skills to clients is what propels me in 
		that field.
