    <mainheading>About</mainheading>
      <div class="divline"></div>
    <br>
    <t>I am currently working toward a Bachelor of Business Associate with a specialization
    in finance graduating December 2019. After narrowing down my interests at Kwantlen Polytechnic, I decided to pursue
    my education full time at Trinity Western University.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am a hard working and ambitious employee who invests personally in any organization
    in which I am placed. I am a natural leader who knows how to create task flows and delegate,
    and also knows how to work in a team environment.
    <br>
    <br>
    A person with diverse experiences and an even more diverse portfolio of interests,
    I draw from many cultures and world views in order to connect with professionals and
    solve problems effectively and efficiently.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the future I want to pursue the CFA professional designation and work internationally to develop
    and manage investments for corporations and financial institutions. In the longer term
    I am interested in bringing my expertise in finance across the world and helping others
    discover more about finance than what they hear on the news.
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition to finance, I have spent time getting familiar with programming and interacting
    with APIs. While I am still learning, I built a Python package called FinMesh which
    allows for easier access to various financial APIs. I continue to learn and expand
    into new languages as my personal time allows.
    <br>
    <br>
    Beyond finance, I am passionate about specialty coffee and film photography. While these
    passions rarely merge with the world of finance I am always looking for intersections between
    the two. The time, attention and science behind a carefully-made cup of coffee
    and the deliberateness of film photography are what draw me to these topics. In the same way,
    attention to detail and curation of financial services and skills to clients is what propels me in
    that field.
