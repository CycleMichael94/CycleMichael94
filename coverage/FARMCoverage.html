		<t>Farmer Brothers Coffee is a roaster, wholesaler, and supplier of coffee and coffee equipment.
		Their product portfolio is currently focused on QSR's, hospitality, and coffee stations.
		The company has more recently begun their foray into "specialty coffee" with the addition of Public Domain Coffees to their line up.
		2017 saw the acquisition and integration of Boyd's Coffee. The coffee market continues to consolidate with large
		players live JAB Holdings, Keurig Green Mountain, Nestle, and Starbucks dominating much of the market(1).
		In terms of retail operations, Farmer Bros does have some small operations, and some coffee may be found in
		supermarkets. The majority of their product offering though is geared towards the areas outlined above.
		<!--SCA Data MUST BE UPDATED ANNUALLY--> In their 2017 U.S. Coffee Market Overview Report, the SCA determined the "away from home"
		coffee market to be worth $63 Billion

		<mainheading>Industry Overview</mainheading>
			<div class="divline"></div>
		<br>
		<t>The coffee market specifically is an interesting one to watch. Most
		of the large players are consolidated under multinational brands or holding groups, with a couple mentioned above.
		This does not mean however that the market is experiencing a squeeze. For as many corporately owned
		coffee shops (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Peet's) as there are, there are also a growing number of independent shops
		looking to reach new avenues of funding and means of expansion. Several notable "indie" shops have been purchased by players
		like JAB such as Blue Bottle and Stumptown. These brands remained rooted in their core values, but retail opportunities
		such as selling bottled cold and packaged beans in grocery store mean a massive increase in revenue.
		For companies for a rather small, localized footprint, accessing the manufacturing facilities and
		building out logistics systems for their product is quite expensive, and is not guaranteed to pay off.
		Large conglomerates have the resources and expertise to lend out to these small business.
		<br>
		The industry also sees solid growth, with the number of coffee drinkers rising and more people drinking coffee outside of
		traditional dayparts.

		<mainheading>Annual Report and Call Highlights</mainheading>
			<div class="divline"></div>
		<br>
		A summarization of key points made in the annual report and 10-K filings, along with
		notes from the most recent investor's conference call.

		<br>
		<heading><u>M&A at Farmer Brothers</u></heading>
		<br>
		<br>
		Acquisitions are key to success for Farmer Brothers. With consolidation on the rise and new shops opening every year, there are opportunities for many large players to egt involved,
		and Farmer Brothers seems positioned to take advantage of that. The company's turnaround and subsequent acquisitions
		prove that the executive team has the experience to tackle large-scale integration projects such as with Boyds and China Mist.
		During their most recent conference call, it was made clear that 1), Farmer Bros would pursue opportunistic M&A, and that 2)
		companies would be "benevolently acquired". This second point is important, because even in non-specialty settings, brand recognition
		is a huge part of the coffee industry and retaining the image of the original brand is important to consumers and businesses alike.
