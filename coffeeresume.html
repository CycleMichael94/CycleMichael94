		<mainheading>About</mainheading>
			<div class="divline"></div>
		<br>
		<t>I am currently working toward a Bachelor of Business Associate with a specialization 
		in finance. After narrowing down my interests at Kwantlen Polytechnic, I decided to pursue 
		my education full time at Trinity Western University. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I am a hard working and ambitious employee who invests personally in any company 
		in which I am placed. I am a natural leader who knows how to create task flows and delegate, 
		but also knows how to work in a team environment.
		<br>
		<br>
		A person with diverse experiences and an even more diverse portfolio of interests, 
		I draw from many cultures and world views in order to connect with customers and co-workers to
		solve problems effectively and efficiently.
		<br>
		<br>
		Beyond finance, I am passionate about specialty coffee and film photography. While these
		passions rarely merge with the world of finance I am always looking for intersections between 
		the two. The time, attention and science behind a carefully-made cup of coffee 
		and the deliberateness of film photography are what draw me to these topics.
		<br>
		<br>
		Although I have learned lots while at Starbucks, my passion for coffee extends much further back.
		From my first coffee in a french press to experimenting with Chemex, cold brew, aeropress,
		and home espresso machines, my intrigue has only grown. I am constantly on the lookout for new 
		information, soaking up every coffee-related video, podcast, article, and experience I possibly can. 
		<br>
		<br>
		While I (currently) do not have any certifications relating to coffee, I try to learn more every day about
		different preparation techniques, cupping, grading, varietals and their characteristics, 
		and roasting. 
		<br>
		<br>
		As I mentioned above, I am always looking for ways in which my education in Finance
		and passion for specialty coffee can mix, and I believe that my experiences, knowledge, and skills are 
		are useful in understanding more that just making coffee, but also the business side of 
		running a shop and delivering value to customers and clients.
